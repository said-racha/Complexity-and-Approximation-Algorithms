Study of the NP-complete Minimum Vertex Cover problem. Implementation of several approximation algorithms (greedy, maximal matching) and exact methods (branch-and-bound with bounding strategies). Evaluation of trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, with the proposal of heuristics to improve the quality of approximate solutions.
